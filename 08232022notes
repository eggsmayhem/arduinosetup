current path:
arduino->hairless MIDI (serial to MIDI converter) -> loopMIDI (MIDI port) -> Reaper

	[ardrumo could be future option for Mac / communicating with Garageband]


Command bytes: (>127)
	Note off = 128
	Note On = 144
	Pitchbend = 224

Data: notes/velocity (<127)
command->data (note)->data (velocity)
144 60 127 = note on, 60(Middle C), 127 (max velocity, which means loudness)

Note off:
	128, 60(example note), 0000
	144, 60, 0 (What we'll likely be using) 


FirstMIDItest -> HairlessMIDI -> loopMIDI -> Reaper
	In Reaper: 
		In Options->Preferences->MIDI Devices, make sure the MIDI port you created in loopMIDI i			is enabled as an input device
		Create a new track
			in : Record(input) -> force format(MIDI)
			IN FX: input -> MIDI -> loopMIDI port
			FX: VSTi: ReaSynth (this is the actual MIDI instrument)
