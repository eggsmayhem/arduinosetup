current path:
arduino->hairless MIDI (serial to MIDI converter) -> loopMIDI (MIDI port) -> Reaper

	[ardrumo could be future option for Mac / communicating with Garageband]

Command : (NOTE ON, PITCH, VOLUME)
Command bytes: (>127)
	Note off = 128
	Note On = 144
	Pitchbend = 224

Data: notes/velocity (<127)
command->data (note)->data (velocity)
144 60 127 = note on, 60(Middle C), 127 (max velocity, which means loudness)

Note off:
	128, 60(example note), 0
	144, 60, 0 (What we'll likely be using) 


FirstMIDItest -> HairlessMIDI -> loopMIDI -> Reaper
	In Reaper: 
		In Options->Preferences->MIDI Devices, make sure the MIDI port you created in loopMIDI i			is enabled as an input device
		Create a new track
			ARM track
			in : Record(input) -> force format(MIDI)
			IN FX: input -> MIDI -> loopMIDI port
			FX: VSTi: ReaSynth (this is the actual MIDI instrument)

1. Don't worry if the Serial monitor in arduino looks like gibberish
2. Don't have arduino's serial monitor open when you open Hairless.
3. Everything should be set at 9600 bauds. This is OK because we are using USB rather than a proper MIDI hardward, for the time being. 

There is no circuit at this point.
